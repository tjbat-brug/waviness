This repository inlcudes python code to calculate the modified Sinuosity Index (SI) first used in Batelaan et al. (2024) `The Influence of Larg-scale Spatial Warming on Extreme Jet Stream Waviness on an Aquaplanet` (https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL108470).

The original data for which the code was designed can be found at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11503351).
